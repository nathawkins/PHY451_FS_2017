# Cavendish Experiment

---


In this experiment, we are going to try and measure a reasonable value of the Gravitational Constant, G = $6.6748 (31) * 10^(-11) m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$. This will be the location where we store all of our data and data analysis scripts (python code).

**Directory structure:**

1. _Data_: This is where we will store all of the data files that we collect during the experiment.

2. _Driven Oscillation_: Where we will conduct analysis on the data collected using the driven oscillation method.

3. _Results_: Store plots and results from calculations.

4. _Scripts_: General analysis, utility scripts.

5. _Uncertainty Calculations_: Mathematica Notebooks for doing the ugly error analysis.
